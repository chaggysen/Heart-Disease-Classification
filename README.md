# Heart-Disease-CLassification
This repo contains a notebook that looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes. 

See Jupyter Notebook for details

## Conclusion:
Through modelling and experimentation, we concluded that LogisticRegression is the best model for our problem.
